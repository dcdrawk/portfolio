				<p>I'm a fourth year student at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts & Technology. I'm also an avid gamer, and I like to view a game as a set of tools needed to solve a problem of complete a quest. Likewise, SIAT has equipped me with a +5 Sword of Mastery needed to tackle any design project, ranging from web design, 3d animation, immersive game design, and much more.</p>

				<p>My two co-op experiences gave me a +5 Shield of Fortitude when it comes to handling a multitude of design projects. These ranged designing posters, brochures, and flyers, to various web design CMS projects using Adobe CQ5 and Wordpress.</p>
				
				<p>I pride myself on being able to solve problems. Whether it's sketching an interface or debugging my code, there's always something to learn and improve upon. Even if I stumble, I will find new ways to approach the design I am working on.</p>

					<h3>Levi & Dodger sez:</h3>
					<p>Hi, we are the <strong>Code Cats</strong>. We helped build this website while Devin was away working on other school projects. Why do we help Devin with his homework? While we 'fall asleep' and watch him type away at his assignment, or sketch out his design ideas. We learn a lot from you silly humans this way.</p>
