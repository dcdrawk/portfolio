						<p>With a creative mind and knack for technology, I’ve always been inspired by the technical side of new media. Currently a Fourth year Media Arts student at SFU’s School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT), my studies and passion for technology have granted me strong technical ability with a growing theoretical skill set in design and interaction methods. This gives me the confidence and understanding to take on any design challenge.</p>

						<p>However, I wouldn't be here today if not for my cute and clever <strong>Coding Cats!</strong></p>
						<h3>Levi & Dodger, Cute Cat Coders</h3>

						<p>Whenever I am in need of an extra set of eyes, these are my go-to cats. They are always willing to lend a paw, and I can't take all the credit. You might see Levi and Dodger throughout my portfolio, offering their own inside-scoop as to what happens behind the scenes.</p>

						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iZy9xFdDFSE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						
						<strong>Summary:</strong>
						<p>Ever been abducted by a UFO? Now's your chance! With a small group of peers, I helped craft a rich and immersive 3D game world. Designed with a Wii Remote in mind, players use the built in gyroscope to navigate and explore.</p>
						<strong>My Role:</strong>
						<p>Concept & Level design, Scripting, Modelling & placing assets</p>
						<strong>Process:</strong>
						<p>After brainstorming our idea, we began by sketching out our framework. Once we were satisfied, we began modelling and gathering assets for our project. As we were constructing our game world, we did multiple user tests to make sure the experience was fun and bug-free.</p>
						<strong>Result:</strong>
						<p>Our project was featured in a class showcase at SFU's Surrey Campus and received a mark of 24/25</p>

						<h1>The Sandwich - Animated Short</h1>
						
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MLEdSgTkL8Y?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						
						<strong>Summary:</strong>
						<p>The Sandwich is an animated short which describes the unfortunate fate of a few fresh ingredients. For this project, I was tasked with lighting, rigging, placing and animating objects. I also modelled and textured several assets, including the chef himself!</p>
						<strong>My Role:</strong>
						<p>Concept & Level design, Scripting, Modelling & placing assets</p>
						<strong>Process:</strong>
						<p>Our animated short began with a series of simple sketches as we finalized our narrative. After, we collaborated together to model, texture, light, and animate our scene. After rendering each frame, we put on the final touches before presenting it to the class.</p>
						<strong>Result:</strong>
						<p>The Sandwich was screened in front of the class and received an A.</p>

						<h1>Kinect - Hand Gesture Remote</h1>
						
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wR8mFl3qczQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						
						<strong>Summary:</strong>
						<p>For this project, we were put into teams of two. Our goal was to take an existing electronic device and minimize it to the extreme. We chose a video remote, and we decided to replace the complex controller with simple hand gestures.</p>
						<strong>My Role:</strong>
						<p>Programmer, Interface Designer.</p>
						<strong>Process:</strong>
						<p>We began by drawing out our ideas and then picking the ones we felt most confident with. We thought about using colour tracking, but we decided that the Kinect was the best way to achieve our desired functionality.</p>
						<strong>Result:</strong>
						<p>The video remote was featured in a class showcase where students and faculty could try it themselves. Our project received an A grade.</p>

						<strong>Summary:</strong>
						<p>This individual assignment challenged my abilities as a media artist. Using the song Harvey the Wonder Hamster by Weird Al Yankovic as the base concept, I brainstormed, storyboarded, and edited until I was happy with the final outcome.</p>
						<strong>My Role:</strong>
						<p>Director, Editor, Concept & Storyboarding</p>
						<strong>Process:</strong>
						<p>This assignment began with brainstorming and storyboarding the rough concept. This concept was submitted for feedback, which I included in the final video. I had to book rooms, rent equiment & instruments, and edit the film.</p>
						<strong>Result:</strong>
						<p>When it was finished,Harvey The Wonder Hamster was shown to the class and received a mark of 23/25.</p>

						<strong>Summary:</strong>
						<p>This was a self-driven effort. During the reading break, I had some free time which I used to design a simple game to explore programming and game logic with Unity. Based on the classic PC game Chip's Challenge, I wanted to replicate simple actions and functions so I could become more proficient with the Unity editor.</p>
						<strong>My Role:</strong>
						<p>Concept Design, Programming, 3D-Modeler</p>
						<strong>Process:</strong>
						<p>I started by studying Chip's challenge, and I mapped out the psudo-code related to certain game functions like picking up a key and unlocking a door. Once I understood, I used my programming, modeling, and research skills in order to bring my vision to life.</p>
						<strong>Result:</strong>
						<p>To guide the design process, I used test players throughout the development. All of the test players remarked on the enjoyable puzzles and retro art style.</p>

						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/B8aPznktkxw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						
						<strong>Summary:</strong>
						<p>An individual assignment, we created a realistic soundscape for a video of our choosing. Using footage from the survival horror game Amnesia: The Dark Descent, I stripped out the audio and substituted it for my own recorded sounds to create a chilling atmosphere.</p>
						<strong>My Role:</strong>
						<p>Sound Designer, Editor, Concept Design</p>
						<strong>Process:</strong>
						<p>When I picked Amnesia, I found a level in the game that matched the atmosphere I wanted to convey. Then I recorded and edited a number of original sounds, as well as selected from library of free sounds. Audio was layered using Pro-Tools and Audacity.</p>
						<strong>Result:</strong>
						<p>My project was presented to the class. My peers and professors were impressed by the "level of atmosphere and complexity."</p>
