							<th>Summary</th>
							<td>The Sandwich is an animated short which describes the unfortunate fate of a few fresh ingredients. For this project, I was tasked with lighting, rigging, placing and animating objects. I also modelled and textured several assets, including the chef himself!</td>

								Our animated short began with a series of simple sketches as we finalized our narrative. After, we collaborated together to model, texture, light, and animate our scene. After rendering each frame, we put on the final touches before presenting it to the class.

					<h3>Dodger sez:</h3>
					<p>For this project, Devin was up really late as he rendered half of the footage while his teammates rendered on the school computers. While he waited for his scenes to render, he threw a toy for me to chase. I was chasing after it when suddenly it disappeared, it must be around here somewhere.</p>

					<p>If you see that fuzzy cat toy somewhere, be a good human and pick it up.</p>
