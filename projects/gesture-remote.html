							<th>Summary</th>
							<td>For this project, we were put into teams of two. Our goal was to take an existing electronic device and minimize it to the extreme. We chose a video remote, and we decided to replace the complex controller with simple hand gestures.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>My Role</th>
							<td>Programmer, Interface Designer.</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<th>Process</th>
							<td>
								We began by drawing out our ideas and then picking the ones we felt most confident with. We thought about using colour tracking, but we decided that the Kinect was the best way to achieve our desired functionality.

					<h3>Dodger sez:</h3>
					<p>I had quite the time watching that odd human wave his at the screen like a crazy person. He would sit there coding for hours, pausing at times to flail his arms to test his interface. When he finally got it working he jumped for joy and scared me fur-less.</p>
					<p>I was so spooked I hid under the bed for a while... but don't tell him that! I don't want him to think I'm a chicken. These don't look like feathers do they?</p>
