					<h3>Levi sez:</h3>
					<p>This was a weird one, I'll tell you that. When I saw him playing with that little stuffed hamster, I almost couldn't stop myself from swatting at it. He even dangled the thing using a piece of string in front of a green piece of paper. What the heck was with that?</p>
					
					<p>After he was done working on the project, I took that damn hamster hostage and put it in one of the human's shoes for safe keeping. When I came back, it was gone! Perhaps Dodger took it and lost it under the couch like he always does.</p>
