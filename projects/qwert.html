							<th>Summary</th>
							<td>This was a self-driven effort. During the reading break, I had some free time which I used to design a simple game to explore programming and game logic with Unity. Based on the classic PC game Chip's Challenge, I wanted to replicate simple actions and functions so I could become more proficient with the Unity editor.</td>

							<th>Process</th>
							<td>
								I started by studying Chip's challenge, and I mapped out the pseudo-code related to certain game functions like picking up a key and unlocking a door. Once I understood, I used my programming, modelling, and research skills in order to bring my vision to life.

							<td>To guide the design process, I used test players throughout the development. All of the test players remarked on the enjoyable puzzles and retro art style.</td>

					<h3>Levi sez:</h3>
					<p>Devin started this project on his reading break. Being mid-February, it wasn't exactly nice outside, so I sat by and watched him get his hands on Unity. He used to play this silly human game called 'Chip's Challenge', and he wanted to recreate that experience in a 3D environment. It took up a lot of his reading break, but he learned more about Unity, which let me tackle his next projects with ease.</p>
