					<p>Over the years, Devin has refined his craft while attending SFU and completing two co-op semesters. After he goes to class, he comes back to lecture us for hours about everything he learned.</p>
					
					<p>This may sound like torture, but we are Code Cats with nothing better to do. We use our skills to help Devin on his assignments to make sure everything is pixel purr-fect</p>
